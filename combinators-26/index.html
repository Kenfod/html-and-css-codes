    <h1>Combinators</h1>
    <pre>
        Combinators are used to combine other selectors in a way that allows us to select elements based on their location in the DOM relative to other elements (for example, child or sibling).

        There are 4 different combinators in CSS:

        #1. Descendant combinator (space) - matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

        #2. Child combinator (>) - selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

        #3. Next sibling (Adjacent) combinator (+) - is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

            Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".

        #4. Subsequent-sibling (General) combinator (~) - selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
