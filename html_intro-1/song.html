        You know what?
        Got something to say
        Craig David
        7 days
        Check it out, yeah

        On my way to see my friends
        Who lived a couple blocks away from me (oh)
        As I walked through the subway
        It must have been about quarter past three
        In front of me
        Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
        She asked me for the time
        I said it'd cost her a name
        A six-digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

        Did she decline? No
        Didn't she mind? I don't think so
        Was it for real? Damn sure
        What was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24
        So was she keen? She couldn't wait
        Cinnamon queen? Let me update
        What did she say?
        She said she'd love to rendezvous
        She asked me what we were gonna do
        Said we'd start with a bottle of Moët for two

        Monday
        Took her for a drink on Tuesday
        We were making love by Wednesday
        And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
        We chilled on Sunday

        I met this girl on Monday
        Took her for a drink on Tuesday
        We were making love by Wednesday
        And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
        We chilled on Sunday

        Nine was the time
        'Cause I'll be getting mine
        And she was looking fine
        Smooth talker
        She told me
        She'd love to unfold me all night long
        Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
        From the front to back she flipped
        (Back she flipped it, ooh, the way she kicked it)

        And I, oh-oh, I yeah
        Hope that she'd care
        'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there
        (Ooh, yeah)

        I'm not a man to play around baby
        (Ooh, yeah)
        'Cause a one-night stand isn't really fair
        From the first impression girl
        Hmm, you don't seem to be like that
        'Cause there's no need to chat, for there'll be plenty for that

        From the subway to my home
        Endless ringing of my phone
        When you're feeling all alone
        All you gotta do
        Is just call me, call me

        Monday
        Took her for a drink on Tuesday
        We were making love by Wednesday
        And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
        We chilled on Sunday

        I met this girl on Monday
        Took her for a drink on Tuesday
        We were making love by Wednesday
        And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
        We chilled on Sunday

        Since I met this special lady
        Ooh, yeah
        I can't get her of my mind
        She's one of a kind
        And I ain't about to deny it
        It's a special kind of thing
        With you, oh

        Monday
        Took her for a drink on Tuesday
        We were making love by Wednesday
        And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
        We chilled on Sunday

        I met this girl on Monday
        Took her for a drink on Tuesday
        We were making love by Wednesday
        And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
        We chilled on Sunday (Sunday, Sunday, Sunday)
